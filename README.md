# Pohtzee
Combination of Poker and Yahtzee - designed to get someone used to all the different hands of poker.

The goal of the game is to get the highest possible poker hand. After exchanging any number of cards in your hand, you will be told which poker hand you ended up with and how many dollars you are rewarded. Each hand played costs $5.

This demonstrates that each round of poker comes at a cost to the player. Also, this game reinforces the value of each hand in poker for easier understanding without all the other complicated rules.

Value of each hand:
  Royal Flush: $500
  Straight Flush: $250
  Four of a Kind: $100
  Full House: $50
  Flush: $25
  Straight: $20
  Three of a Kind: $15
  Two Pair: $10
  Pair: $5
  Jack or Higher: $1 (demonstrating that it is possinle to win with a high card but very unlikely)
  anything else: $0
